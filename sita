Hi
My name is sita
I was the wife of Lord Ram in Ramayana
I was abducted by Ravana when I along with Lord Rama and Lakshmana were on a exile for 14 yrs
I was kept in Ashok Vatika for the duration of my captivation and was inflicted with all kinds of atrocities
by the demon King Ravana and his subjects
